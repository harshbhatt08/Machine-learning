# Machine Learning Overview

## Definition
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms allowing computers to learn patterns and make decisions without explicit programming.

## Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

## Supervised Learning
**Definition:** Learning from labeled data.
**Example:** Classification, Regression.

## Unsupervised Learning
**Definition:** Learning from unlabeled data.
**Example:** Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction.

## Semi-Supervised Learning
**Definition:** Combination of labeled and unlabeled data.

# Key Steps in Machine Learning

## Data Collection
Collect relevant data for training and testing.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values.
- Normalize/standardize data.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Split data into training and testing sets.

## Model Selection
Choose an appropriate model based on the problem (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks).

## Model Training
Feed training data into the model.
Adjust model parameters to minimize error.

## Model Evaluation
Test the model on unseen data.
Evaluate performance using metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize model hyperparameters for better performance.

## Model Deployment
Deploy the trained model for making predictions on new data.

# Common Algorithms

## Linear Regression
**Formula:** \(y = mx + b\)

# Evaluation Metrics

## Classification
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix.

## Regression
- Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.

# Overfitting and Underfitting

## Overfitting
Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.

## Underfitting
Model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns.

# Bias-Variance Tradeoff

- **Bias:** Error due to overly simplistic assumptions.
- **Variance:** Error due to too much complexity.
